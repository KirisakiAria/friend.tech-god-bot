您好！
我是 Friend.tech God Bot 的开发者。这是一个针对 Friend.tech (Twi: https://twitter.com/friendtech)开发的 telegram bot 程序。

In general, Friend.tech has seen enormous growth, with its TVL at the time of writing standing at $52.31 million and the number of users hitting 305,892. Furthermore, since dawn, the protocol has recorded an inflow of about 213 million ETH, translating into $349.7 million.
The number of daily transactions has changed daily, with the highest of 539.8k transactions recorded on September 13. The cumulative number of transactions was 9.17 million at the time of writing.

Friend.tech 现在注册用户相比于加密领域用户只占用很小的一部分比例，更不用提这里面有很多 bot 和工作室批量注册的用户。再加上一直持续到年底的积分空投活动，我们认为 Friend.tech 现在仍在初期，就好像是四月初的 brc20，Friend.tech 将在接下来一到两个月的时间出现大爆发状态。我们认为 Friend.tech 有着广阔的市场前景，因为我们开发了一个辅助用户的机器人 —— Friend.tech God Bot。

此机器人的主要功能有：

1. 钱包管理
2. 跟单买入
3. 买入卖出任意数量的 key
4. 首次购买钥匙反狙击手
5. 通过用户名查询地址或者通过地址反查用户名
   其中 2 和 4 是本机器人的核心功能。跟单功能可以允许用户监控一些钱包，当这些钱包买入 key 时，用户可以紧跟着他们买入。而首次购买钥匙反狙击手则可以让用户在注册账户之后批量买入自己的 key 而不被狙击机器人抢先（Friend.tech 开户之后，前端用户首先要买入一次自己的 key，然后才能在应用程序前端继续买入自己或者他人的 key，而且前端也无法在单次交易批量购买，只有通过调用链上合约才能做到）。这个功能我们认为会对接下来未注册 Friend.tech 的加密红人们产生巨大影响，之前我们经常看到加密红人抱怨狙击机器人速度太快，以至于他们自己尚未买入太多自己 key 的时候就已经被机器人抢先去了，而我们的反狙击购买则可以未这些尚未加入的加密红人们保驾护航。

每次购买和卖出，我们将收取总价格的 1.4%作为手续费。反狙击功能则会在此基础上加上 0.004ETH 作为手续费。

此项目已经在近期上线，运行了不到一周左右。我们希望能与贵公司建立合作关系，投资我们并且帮我们进行推广。我们可以提供手续费的分成，后面当用户多起来时我们也有 token 的发行计划，持有我们的 token 可以享受手续费分成以及后续开发的额外高级功能。

此外，我们还在开发一个埋伏机器人，它会不断扫描新买入的地址，能够根据一个优化好的模型进行评估此地址是否值得买入并持有，将来卖出以获利。

如果您对我们的项目有兴趣，请联系我们，我们是初创业者，资金和人脉有限但是技术顶尖，工作态度认真出色，希望能够得到贵司的青睐！

Hello.
I am the developer of Friend.tech God Bot. This is a telegram bot program developed for Friend.tech (Twi: https://twitter.com/friendtech).

In general, Friend.tech has seen enormous growth, with its TVL at the time of writing standing at $52.31 million and the number of users hitting 305,892. Furthermore, since dawn, the protocol has recorded an inflow of about 213 million ETH, translating into $349.7 million.

Quoted from: https://cryptopotato.com/friend-techs-earnings-hit-18-4-million-in-just-2-months/

Friend.tech now has a very small percentage of registered users compared to the crypto space, not to mention a lot of bot and studio bulk registrations. Coupled with the airdrops that will continue until the end of the year, we think Friend.tech is still in its infancy, and like brc20 at the beginning of April, Friend.tech is poised to explode in the next month or two. We think Friend.tech has a great future in the market because we have developed a bot that assists users - the Friend.tech God Bot.

The main functions of this bot are:

1. wallet management
2. buy orders
3. buy and sell any number of keys
4. buying keys for the first time against snipers
5. checking address by username or checking username back by address
   2 and 4 are the core functions of the bot. The followers feature allows the user to monitor some wallets, and when these wallets buy keys, the user can follow them. The first-time key buyer anti-sniper allows users to buy their own keys in bulk after registering an account without being preempted by the sniper bots (after opening an account with Friend.tech, the front-end user has to buy their own key once before they can continue to buy their own or other people's keys on the front-end of the application, and the front-end can't buy in bulk for a single transaction, it can only do so by calling the on-chain (only by invoking an on-chain contract). This is a feature that we think will have a huge impact on the next crypto-bloggers who have not yet signed up for Friend.tech, as we have often seen crypto-bloggers complaining that the sniping bots are so fast that the bots get to them before they can buy too many of their own keys, and our anti-sniping purchases will protect these crypto-bloggers who have not yet signed up for Friend.tech.

We charge 1.4% of the total price for each purchase and sale. The anti-sniping feature will add 0.004ETH to this fee.

This program has recently gone live and has been running for less than a week or so. We hope to establish a cooperative relationship with your company, invest in us and help us to promote. We can provide a share of the commission, and later when the number of users increases, we also have a token issuance program, holding our token can enjoy a share of the commission as well as the subsequent development of additional advanced features.

In addition, we are also developing an ambush bot, which will constantly scan for new addresses to buy, and will be able to evaluate whether the address is worth buying and holding based on an optimized model, and then sell in the future to make a profit.

If you are interested in our project, please contact us, we are start-ups with limited funds and connections but top technology, serious and excellent work ethic, we hope to be able to get your company's favor!
